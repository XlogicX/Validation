# Validation

Your a budding socialite sold on the concept that social networking helps keep you 'connected' to your social circle and more. You feel validated when people that know you like your posts and even share them with others. You can't please everyone though, about 2/3 of the time, your posts go into silence. That's okay though, the sudden rush of validation that you get from liked/shared posts is enough to sustain you. Your goal is to come to the end of your life validated. But the real question becomes: how much validation is enough validation? Will you be able to achieve this level of excellence?

## Game Play
You roll a slot machine of validation. Any key on the keyboard will roll the slot machine. This represents posting to social media and then constantly refreshing to see if any of your connections have validated you. Depending on the results of the roll, either nothing will happen, you'll get validated, or in some cases, lose validation. You start with 0x100 validation, this will show up in the top left after your first roll. Your life timer shows at the bottom left, it consistently counts regardless of game play. If the life timer gets up to (or past) 0x2600 (a little less than 9 real minutes), then you have 'died of old age.' Whether you win or lose depends on how much validation you have.

## Validation Points
There are 7 different images in the slot machine. 5 of them are validating images (likes, hearts, retweets, etc...). One of them is an image that represents cyber-bullying, and another image represents getting hit by a bus while distracted checking your online validation. The point system is slightly complex.

### Gaining Validation
In general, if you get any two matching validating images, you will gain 9 points of validation.

If you get all 3 matching validating images, then you feel 29 points of validation.

If you get 2 (but not 3) matching bus images, rejoice, you just successfully dodged the bus/car. You were slightly distracted checking for validation, but not so much to not be able to dodge oncoming traffic. Though you didn't receive validation online, your smug feeling of multitasking your awareness of the outside world gives you validation anyway (9 points).

You also every now and then (very infrequntly) get awarded just 1 point of IRL validation. This kind of validation can feel small and subtle. It's also not as random and thrilling as some of the big rewards of thousands of likes, its boring, slow, and steady. Chances of getting it only happen when not checking for validation on social media. Think of the scenario where your eating dinner with friends or a loved one, and your looking down at your phone when they are talking at you. This is in contrast to actually talking to the person right in front of you. You wont be alerted to this 1 point of validation, it will be calculated in the background, but it will be accuratly represented in the total score in the next time you check for your validation.

### Losing Validation
When you check for validation (take a roll on the slot machine), there is no guarantee that you will get validated. In fact, the chances that all the images will be neutrally validating is about 2/3. In other words, you just poured your heart out to your social network, and you either get silence from them or you did get some likes, just not as much as your wild expectations were. In the process, you will see your connections making posts showing their life in the best light that makes yours look like complete garbage in comparison. All of this feels lonely and depressing, you lose 5 points of validation.

If you get 2 cyber-bullying images, your validation takes a huge hit (losing 146 points). Given the odds of getting cyber-bullied, it is possible to make it through your entire lifetime without getting bullied, but there's still a good chance it will happen once to even a few times if your a good victim. This could represent other kinds of bullying as well, such as the scenario of getting popcorn thrown at you in a movie theater because you can't be bothered to sit still for about 90 minutes and not check for validation. These obnoxious scenarious are truly becoming limiteless.

Getting all 3 images of cyber-bullying can be really devastating, you lose 219 points for this scenario. There's also an edge case: You make a post, people validate you by liking or sharing your post, but there are also people cyber-bullying you on the same post. Even though you are being validated, the negative emotional effects of the bullying nets you less validation then if you didn't make the post at all; negative comments have a much more powerful effect than positive ones of equal frequency. So in the case that you get 2 matching validation images and 1 cyberbully image, you lose 73 points of validation.

### Early Death
One way to die early is to get 3 bus images. In this case, you weren't aware enough of your environment while vainly checking for validation. When the 3 bus images line up, you get hit by the bus, and you ded. Another way you can die is slightly more complex and takes more time to occur. You start with 0x100 (256) points of validation. Though it's not common, it is possible to get to 0 points due to a combination of cyber-bullying and constantly checking ones status. In the case that your validation gets so low that you feel just totally worthless, you commit suicide due to depression, you ded.

### Winning
You must merely have enough validation by the time you die of old age. You get no prize in earning that validation early, life can always take a turn for the worse down the road. What matters is how you feel about yourself when your time has naturally come. I'm not sure if I should give away this secret to happiness, but there is one way to consistently win each and every time, no matter the odds.
